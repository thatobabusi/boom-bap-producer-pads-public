# DSP controls & output routing

**In one line:** the knobs that shape how the selected pad sounds, and how to send a pad to its own channel in your DAW.

## What this part of the plugin is for

"DSP" just means sound processing. Below the sample editor on the PADS tab
is a row of controls that always follow the selected pad. They include a
filter (make it darker or brighter), an envelope (how the sound fades in and
out), pitch and speed, and effects like reverse and lo-fi bitcrush. Every
knob can be automated in your DAW or controlled from a MIDI knob.

## What's in this folder

| File | What you'll learn |
|---|---|
| [dsp-controls.md](dsp-controls.md) | Filter, envelope (A/D/S/R), Tune/Fine/Speed, Time-Stretch (change speed without changing pitch), Key Snap, Reverse, Bitcrush, Loop, Play To End, Normalize, the fader-style "Mixer Strips" view, and [output routing](dsp-controls.md#output-routing) (giving pads 1-16 their own outputs in your DAW) |

## Questions this answers

- *How do I speed a sample up without it going chipmunk?* Turn on Time-Stretch, then change Speed.
- *Why does my pad sound muffled?* Check the filter Cutoff; fully open is 20 kHz.
- *How do I process the kick on its own in my DAW?* Enable that pad's own output in your DAW's routing. See Output routing in the guide.
- *My sample is too quiet.* Use Normalize.
